Manage your cardboard capital.

## About

MTGCapital is an app to manage and track your Magic: The Gathering card specs. It is 
very straight-forward and easy to use, and has a clean and simple interface.

Search for any Magic card.
Find it and add it to your 'Interests' page with the amount you bought and the price 
you bought them at.
Track your interests and see how much you've gained or lost over time.
When it's time to sell, input how much you sold and at what amount.
The cards will be moved over to the Margins page for record keeping with the amount you
gained or lost on that spec.
See your yearly gains/losses in chart form.
Tracks as many years as you have data for.

Pricing is based on TCG Market price, and it updated daily.
